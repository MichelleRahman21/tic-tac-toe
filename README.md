##Name:

Tic-Tic-Tac-Tac-Toe-Toe


##Description:

This is one of my first projects and I would like to say that it was very challenging for me, especially because I wasn’t sure how to put all that knowledge that I gathered in three weeks in one project that needed to be finish within 5 days.

I started working on this project on Thursday 16th 2019, with no idea on where to start.
General Assembly provided me with the documentation and an API, so for this project that was really helpful. I noticed that I had all the information that I needed to start with but there was one thing missing; I didn’t know how to start or where to start.

I read the options of schedules that were provided for this project; the first option suggested me to start working with the board game so it was only HTML5  and the second one suggested me to begin with the user authentication.
I decided to begin with the user authentication because I felt more comfortable, I also thought that it could be a good idea to start working on that, that way the user would be able to sign-up, sign-in, change-password and sign-out. After that it was just a matter of creating my board game, game logic, event handlers and events listeners.

##Problem Solving Strategies:


-Syntax: Checked for misspelled words, especially plurals or the letter “S” weather is plural, verb or noun.

-Grunt serve: Run my web application to check if everything is working.

-Developer Tools: Open my web application in the browser, click on developer tools, open my console, click in network to see details of the possible errors.

-Stack Overflow: If there is an error that I can not recognize it’s solution ask for help, most likely there will be an answer for that on Stack Overflow.

-Documentation: Look for resources or ways to rewrite the code, I love using Mozilla documentation.

##Technical Requirements:

-Use a custom game engine written by you.
-Be a single-page application, no browser refresh.
-Render a game board in the browser.
-Switch turns between X and O (or whichever markers you select). Tip: Assume player X is the first player to start the game.
-Visually display which side won if a player gets three in a row or show a draw if neither wins.
-Support playing multiple games, one at a time.
-Use jQuery for DOM manipulation and event handling.
-Use AJAX for interacting with a provided API.

##API Requirements:

-Create new games on the server. (CREATE)
-Update a game by storing new moves. (UPDATE)
-Visually display the results of retrieving game statistics, such as total games won by a user. (READ)
-Give feedback to the user after each action.

##Authentication Requirements:

-Signup with email, password, and password confirmation.
-Login with email and password.
-Logout when logged in.
-Change password with current and new password.
-Signup and Signin must only be available to not signed in users.
 -Logout and Change password must only be available to signed in users.


##Technologies used:
-HTML5
-CSS
-JavaScript
-Bootstrap
-SASS
-SPA
-AJAX for interacting with a provided Heroku API.
-JQuery for DOM manipulation and event handling.
-Command Line running grunt serve ( must of the time ) to test my project on the browser.
-GitHub : Commit, Merge, create Issues and Deploy once the project was done.
